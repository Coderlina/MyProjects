### Game of Life
Game of Life is an Unity game based on Conway's Game of Life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). The player can place cells on the gameboard and start the timer. When time passes, the cell generations change. In every change, cells live, die or become alive by depending on how many of the neighbouring cells are alive.
